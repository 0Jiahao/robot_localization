<!-- Launch file for utm_transform_node -->

<!-- 
     This node requires three inputs:
     (1) A sensor_msgs/Imu message with a magnetometer-based absolute heading (yaw).
     (2) A nav_msgs/Odometry message with raw UTM coordinates in it, as is output by the utm_odometry_node of gps_common. 
         The frame_id of the UTM Odometry message must be unique; i.e., it cannot match the frame_id of your position 
         estimate Odometry  message (which presumably comes from robot_localization). 
     (3) A nav_msgs/Odometry message that contains the robot's current position estimate in the frame specified by its start
         location. This should just be the output of robot_localization.

     The output of this node is a tf transform from the frame_id of the UTM Odometry message (input (2)) to the frame_id of the 
     robot's current Odometry message frame (input (3)). This means the user can simply add input (2) as an Odometry message
     source for any state estimation node in robot_localization (currently just ekf_localization_node). robot_localization will
     transform incoming messages into the correct frame before integrating them.
